You may access my code at https://github.com/ryankarel/cs-7641-supervised-learning

To run this code, first install the appropriate virtual environment using the `env.yml` file in the root directory of the repo.

After this, please visit plot_generation.py. This is the main script that calls the other scripts, producing plots for use in the write up. The write up can then be found in the `latex` directory.
